In roughly descending order of priority (most important listed first)

- More tests - The tests/ subdirectory needs more tests.  There are only a few
tests that actually talk to DynamoDB.  At a minimum we need tests for all
operations that actually talk to DynamoDB.  We need to get better code
coverage.  Maybe even use gconv to monitor the amoun of code coverage.
[effort: large]

- Add documentation in header files for all public APIs. We use the Linux
kernel documentation style.  See the definition of aws_dynamo_set_endpoint()
in ./src/aws_dynamo.h for an example.
[effort: medium]

- Need to finish support for number sets.  I think this should include changing
the way we store numbers in the attribute structures.  There is too much
indirection.  I am thinking at least this:

[effort: small, but will be an API change as described]

- Need to finish support for floating point numbers.
[effort: small]

- Look at x-amz-crc32 header in response and use it to verify response
integrity, could use zlib for crc32.  This header was added in a recent
API update.  It is important to take advantage of this header
[effort: medium]

- Add support for "UnprocessedKeys" in batch get item resposne.
[effort: medium]

- Build and test on various systems, fix anything that doesn't work.
Any system where the dependancies are available should be usable.
[effort: medium]

- add support for B (Binary) and BS (Binary Set) types
[effort: medium]

- add support for more error codes: UnrecognizedClientException,
  413 (Request Entity too large)
[effort: small]

- Consider fixing the json parsers to accept new keys without exiting with
  an error.  Maybe they should just print a warning and support new objects of
  any depth.
[effort: large]

- extract x-amzn-RequestId header and include it in error messages
[effort: small]

- Integrate the AWS Signature v4 test suite:
  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-test-suite.html
  There are a large number of test inputs in there that can be integrated into
  out test suite.
[effort: medium]

- add support for DynamoDB v2
